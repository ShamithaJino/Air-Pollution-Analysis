# Air Pollution Analysis 2002 to 2024
## About This Project

Air pollution affects public health, climate, and the environment. In this project, I analyzed air pollution data across the United States to understand which sectors create the most emissions and how pollution has changed from 2002 to 2024.

I compared pollution levels across states to identify which states have higher or lower emissions. I also examined whether growth in renewable energy such as solar and wind is linked to lower pollution levels. In addition, I explored whether states with more registered vehicles tend to have higher emissions.

## Data Sources

This project uses publicly available government datasets from trusted sources.

Air pollution data from the Environmental Protection Agency covering the years 2002 to 2024

Renewable energy data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration

Vehicle registration data from Data.gov

State boundary data from the U.S. Census Bureau for mapping and state level analysis

These datasets allowed state level, sector level, and pollutant level analysis.

## Data Preparation

The raw datasets were not ready for analysis and required cleaning and transformation.

The main preparation steps included separating combined columns, reshaping year data into a structured format, handling missing values, converting emission units, and merging datasets using state and year. Geographic data was also integrated to create state level maps and compare pollution, renewable energy, and vehicle trends together.

## Analysis Focus

This project focused on answering the following questions:

Which sectors create the most pollution

How air pollution changed from 2002 to 2024

Which states have the highest emissions

Which pollutants contribute the most overall

How renewable energy has grown over time

Whether states increasing renewable energy show lower emissions

Whether higher vehicle growth is associated with higher pollution

## Tools Used

Python including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and GeoPandas

Power BI for interactive dashboards

Jupyter Notebook for analysis

PowerPoint for presenting insights


## Conclusion

This analysis shows that air pollution in the United States has significantly decreased between 2002 and 2024. The biggest improvements occurred in transportation and fuel combustion sectors.

Major pollutants such as CO, SO2, and NOx declined due to cleaner vehicle technologies, improved fuel standards, stricter environmental regulations, and the growth of renewable energy.

Overall, the results suggest that policy actions and the transition to clean energy have played an important role in reducing air pollution.
