# Air-Pollution-Analysis
## About This Project

Air pollution affects public health, the climate, and the environment. In this project, I looked at the different sectors in the dataset to see which ones create the most pollution and how emissions have changed over time. I also compared pollution levels across states to understand which states are higher or lower. Then I explored whether using more renewable energy like solar and wind is linked to lower pollution, and whether states with more vehicles tend to have higher emissions.

## What Data I Used

I used government datasets from trusted sources, including EPA air pollution data (2002–2024), renewable energy data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, vehicle registration data from Data.gov, and state boundary data from the U.S. Census Bureau to create maps and analyze trends across states.


## What I Did With the Data

The data was not ready to use at first, so I had to clean and organize it before starting the analysis by separating combined columns, reshaping the year data, handling missing values, converting units, and merging everything by state and year. I also added map data so I could create state-level visuals and compare pollution, renewable energy, and vehicle trends together.


## What I Analyzed

Which sectors create the most pollution

How pollution has changed from 2002 to 2024

Which states have the highest emissions

Which pollutants contribute the most

How renewable energy has grown over time

Whether states increasing renewable energy show lower emissions

Whether states with more vehicles have higher pollution
